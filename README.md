# Syntactic and Semantic Checker for C language

This is a course project of the course Compiler Design at IIT Kanpur.

In this project we made a program that takes a C code as input and checks if there are any syntactic or semantic errors and reports all those errors with a brief discription of the errors. 

Features supported are:
* All Data Types supported by C
* Variables and Expressions (global variables are supported)
* Control Structures (loops, conditional statements)
* Arrays
* Functions (recursion, mutual recursion are also supported)
* User-defined types (union, struct - with typedef supported)
* Pointers ( also generates warnings if used carelessly)
